Calculates your baby's developmental leaps from an estimated due date, shows an easy timeline with explanations and optional local reminders.

For parents and caregivers who want a simple, private tool to follow early developmental phases.

The data is based on the CDC milestones. The CDC milestones are based on the 75th percentile, which means that 75% or more of children reach these skills by the stated age. WHO data show the normal range of variation (1st to 99th percentile) across six international populations. All timings are approximate; individual developmental trajectories can vary considerably without being pathological.
