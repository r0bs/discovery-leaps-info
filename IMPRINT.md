### Liability for Content

The contents of our pages were created with great care. However, we cannot guarantee that the content is accurate, complete or up-to-date. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws. However, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon becoming aware of corresponding legal violations, we will remove this content immediately.

### Liability for Links

Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
