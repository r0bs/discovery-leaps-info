# Privacy Policy

Last updated: [Date]

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes our data practices for our mobile application ("App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection and Storage

**We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.**

All data you create or input within the App is stored exclusively on your device. The App:
- Does not track your activity
- Does not transmit any data to external servers
- Does not collect any personal information
- Does not use analytics or tracking services
- Does not share any information with third parties

## Local Data Storage

Any data you create within the App (such as user-generated content, settings, or preferences) is stored only on your local device. This data:
- Remains under your complete control
- Is not accessible to us or any third parties
- Can be deleted by uninstalling the App or clearing the App's data through your device settings

## Data Security

Since all data remains on your device, the security of your data depends on the security measures you have in place on your device, such as:
- Device passcode or biometric authentication
- Device encryption
- Physical security of your device

We recommend keeping your device secure and up-to-date with the latest security patches.

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children. Since no data is transmitted or collected, the App is safe for users of all ages.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect or store any of your personal data on our servers, there is no personal data for us to access, modify, or delete. You have complete control over any data stored locally on your device.
